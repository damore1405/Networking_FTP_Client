i included a makefile for a lil easier compilation... the use is as follows:
	Host="hostname" LogFilePath="logFilePath" make run
	or...
	Host="hostname" LogFilePath="logFilePath" Port="" make run
	
or just compile the JavaFtpClient.java then run with the params in the following format

i ran two samples, one using a ipv6 server on my localhost ::1, and another using the server that professor Kain put up. That way i can show functionality for pasv/port and epsv/eprt.
